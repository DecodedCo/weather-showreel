Weather ShowReel Library
===========

A library for creating a show reel, with historical city information

This library will allow you to visualise historical city weather temperatures, using data from http://openweathermap.org/ and a [d3 visualisation](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1256572).

### Instructions 

1. Copy the html code in sublime text and save in the sites folder. Set the file name to index.html
2. Copy the js code in sublime text and save again in the sites folder. Set the file name to script.html
3. From your browser go to: localhost:8000

 (a webserver has already been set up for the visualisation to display properly)
4. That's it! 

If you would like to change the cities that are being displayed, edit line 37 in the html code.
